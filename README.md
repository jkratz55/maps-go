# Maps

Maps is a library of functions for manipulating and working with maps in Go. Generics being added in Go 1.18 added new possibilities for writing type safe libraries to bring common idioms from other languages into Golang. However, at its core, this library is useful functions I've found myself writing or wanting when working in Go.
